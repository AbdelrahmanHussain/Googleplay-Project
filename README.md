# üì± Google Play Store Apps Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## üìå Introduction
The Google Play Store hosts millions of applications, and the data associated with these apps offers significant potential for analysis.  
Developers, researchers, and businesses can leverage this data to:
- Understand market trends
- Optimize their applications
- Maximize user engagement  

In this project, I focused on **data cleaning and preprocessing** for the Play Store Apps dataset.  
The main goal was to fix inconsistencies, handle missing values, detect outliers, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Tasks

The following cleaning and preprocessing tasks were performed:

1. **Fix `Rating`**  
   - Converted to numeric values  
   - Handled invalid or missing ratings  

2. **Fix `Size`**  
   - Converted sizes from strings (e.g., "10M", "1.2k") to numeric (in MB)  

3. **Fix `Price`**  
   - Removed currency symbols  
   - Converted price column to float  

4. **Fix `Category`**  
   - Standardized category names  
   - Removed invalid or duplicate entries  

5. **Fix `Android Version`**  
   - Extracted numeric version values  
   - Handled missing or invalid entries  

6. **Handle Missing Values**  
   - Imputed or dropped rows with missing data based on context  

7. **Outlier Detection & Handling**  
   - Detected extreme values in columns like `Reviews`, `Installs`, and `Price`  
   - Treated them using statistical methods (IQR, z-score)  

8. **General Fixes**  
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Ensured consistent formatting across all columns

## üìà Insights & Outcomes
- The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or machine learning.  
- Preprocessing allowed extraction of meaningful insights such as:
  - Distribution of app ratings
  - Relationship between installs and reviews
  - Market trends by category and content rating  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Apply **Machine Learning models** for predictions (e.g., predicting rating or installs)  
- Visualize trends with charts and dashboards
